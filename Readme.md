# 🚀 Daily Coding Practice Repository

## 📌 Repository Purpose

This repository is a **structured collection of daily coding problems and solutions**, focused on:

* Strengthening problem-solving skills
* Understanding multiple approaches to the same problem
* Writing clean, efficient, and scalable code

Problems are solved **day by day**, with an emphasis on:

* Clear logic
* Optimization
* Interview-ready explanations

---

## 🧠 Practice Philosophy

Each problem is approached in stages:

1. **Initial / Intuitive Solution** – to understand the problem
2. **Optimized Solution** – to handle large constraints efficiently
3. **Explanation & Comparison** – to document learning

This mirrors how problems are solved in **interviews and real-world engineering**.

### Structure Details

* **`java/`**
  Contains all Java-based solutions.

* **`DAY-<number>/`**
  Each folder represents one day of problem-solving.

* **`ProblemStatement.md`**
  Original problem description for the day.

* **`Solution1.java`**
  First-pass solution (usually brute force, greedy, or simulation).

* **`Solution2.java`**
  Optimized solution using better algorithms or mathematics.

* **Day-level `README.md`**
  Explains:

  * The problem
  * Different approaches
  * Complexity analysis
  * Key learnings

---

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

* Build consistency through **daily practice**
* Improve algorithmic thinking
* Learn to optimize solutions
* Create a personal reference for future interviews

---

## 📈 Target Audience

* Software engineering students
* Interview preparation candidates
* Developers improving DSA skills
* Anyone following a **daily coding discipline**

---

## 🔧 How to Use This Repository

1. Start from the `java/` folder
2. Pick a day (`DAY-1`, `DAY-2`, …)
3. Read the problem statement
4. Review the solutions in order
5. Study the explanation in the day README

---

## 📝 Notes

* Solutions are written with **clarity over cleverness**
* Multiple approaches are intentional
* Edge cases and constraints are considered

---

## 📌 Final Thought

> Consistency beats intensity.
> This repository is a step-by-step journey toward better problem-solving.
